I just found an old project that I built to solve solutions to the challenges of Java course at [Udemy](https://www.udemy.com/course/java-the-complete-java-developer-course/)

I just have done very small changes to the solutions to work with latest lts version.

The project is not even for half the course for many reasons:

* I have created many projects to solve issues
* I have quit the course many times because of lack of time and got back with different projects and start
* I was very young, and I wasn't really interested to share my code with others even if they care about it

But now I do.

Thank you for your time.
